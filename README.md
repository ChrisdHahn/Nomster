# README

Nomster is one of the apps that I created under the guidance of The Firehose Project. It's kind of like a Yelp clone, but broken down in a much simpler format.

It focuses on the following skills:
- Ruby on Rails Framework
- User Comments
- Star rating system
- Image uploading through carrierwave
- User authentication
- Integrating Google Map API
- Pagination

Although it was supposed to be a simple app, I added some features on my own after finishing the project.

I implemented:
- Masonry Gem
- Kaminari (Through some JavaScript code)

This app is allowed to be seen here: [Nomster](https://nomster-chris-hahn.herokuapp.com)
